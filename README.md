## Introduction

I'm an Android engineer who is obsessed with performance. In early 2025, I found my legacy works _too noisy_ and much closer to a typical CRUD engineer's repo, so I deleted them 😄

Instead of showcasing apps that are difficult to measure, I decided to build SDKs that solve real-world issues with clear measurements and top tier performance.

Open to senior Android roles where system design and performance are top priority.
