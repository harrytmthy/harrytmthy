# Hi, I'm Harry Timothy 👋

Senior Android Engineer with a deep passion for crafting secure and performant Android apps. My work centers around thoughtful architecture, meaningful optimizations, and clarity-first collaboration.

Currently refining [**SafeBox**](https://github.com/harrytmthy/safebox), a blazing-fast, memory-safe, encrypted alternative to the deprecated `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. Designed from the ground up for apps demanding peak security and performance.

## 📦 Featured Projects

- **[SafeBox](https://github.com/harrytmthy/safebox)**  
  A high-performance encrypted key-value storage SDK featuring ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, memory-mapped I/O, and robust concurrency support.

- **[Sanctum](https://github.com/harrytmthy/sanctum)** *(coming soon)*  
  A privacy-focused journaling app, emphasizing clean architecture, offline-first functionality, and secure local encryption.
